## Changing Tracks Multiplier / Single Player
Changing tracks on single player is a lot more time intensive and indepth so it is recommended that you use multiple server to seperate players

## Multiplayer
1. First stop the server from running and make sure no Pods are currently connected to it

3. Select which track you would like
4. Save changes to the server config
